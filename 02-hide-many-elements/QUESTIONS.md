# DOM Atomic 02: Hide Many Elements

## Questions

---

> How did you go about selecting the DOM elements to hide? Describe the "contract" for that function.

Welp, the id's for the elements to hide were marked as "hide_me" so I that that would be a good place to start. :)

> Describe how you were able to hide each element. Were you able to do it as one operation, or did you use a loop of some kind? Describe the "contracts" that were utilized to accomplish your goal.

I used a loop and it was weird. I figured since I was trying to perform an action on a collection of objects I would need to loop through the collection to perform the action on each one.
